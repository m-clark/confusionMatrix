#' @name confusionMatrix

#' @description  The goal of this package is primarily to provide an easy
#'   way to provide confusion table metrics in a tidy fashion.  The inspiration
#'   and a good chunk of the code borrows heavily from Max Kuhn's \code{caret}
#'   package and associated function \code{confusionMatrix}.  Here, practically
#'   all dependencies have been removed outside of dplyr, and results return
#'   tibbles making for easier document presentation, as well as the ability to
#'   peel off the statistics desired.
